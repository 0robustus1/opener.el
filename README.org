* opener.el â€” open urls as buffers

  - opener: [[https://melpa.org/#/opener][file:https://melpa.org/packages/opener-badge.svg]]

  opener.el is a small package that provides the user with the ability to open
  files from http-like sources directly inside an Emacs buffer.  This means that
  if the URL in question gives string hints to be a plaintext file, that isn't
  automatically being rendered into a pleasant representation, like for example
  html files are, it will be opened inside an Emacs buffer.

  The current main example for this is opening URLs that yield XML or JSON
  responses, which are potentially even gzipped (think sitemaps for example).

** dependencies
   - for /opener/:
     - /request/
   - additionally for /evil-opener/:
     - /evil/

** HowTo
   evil-opener hooks into /evil-mode/ and provides an =:opener[!] FILE-OR-URL= ex-state
   command. Use it the same as you would use =:edit[!] FILE=, with the added
   benefit that you can open urls.

   This package also hooks into evil to redefine the =gf= normal-state command. It
   now can perform the same tasks that =:opener= could perform on file or url at
   point.

   For more detailed information please consult the =evil-opener.info= file.

   Opener can also be used without /evil/. To do that require the /opener/ package
   instead of the /evil-opener/ package. More information can be found in the
   =opener.info= file.
