* opener.el â€” open urls as buffers

opener.el is a small package that provides the user with the ability to open
files from http-like sources directly inside an Emacs buffer.  This means that
if the URL in question gives string hints to be a plaintext file, that isn't
automatically being rendered into a pleasant representation, like for example
html files are, it will be opened inside an Emacs buffer.

The current main example for this is opening URLs that yield XML or JSON
responses, which are potentially even gzipped (think sitemaps for example).

** dependencies

- /request/
- /evil/, this is an optional dependency.
  While the package doesn't require it to perform its normal function it is
  highly recommended to reap the convenience benefits, like ex-state command and
  remapping of `gf` to open url at point.

** HowTo

Opener hooks into /evil-mode/ and provides an =:opener[!] FILE-OR-URL= ex-state
command. Use it the same as you would use =:edit[!] FILE=, with the added
benefit that you can open urls.

This package also hooks into evil to redefine the =gf= normal-state command. It
now can perform the same tasks that =:opener= could perform on file or url at
point.
