;;; Commentary:

;; opener.el is a small package that provides the user with the ability to open
;; files from http-like sources directly inside an Emacs buffer.  This means that
;; if the URL in question gives string hints to be a plaintext file, that isn't
;; automatically being rendered into a pleasant representation, like for example
;; html files are, it will be opened inside an Emacs buffer.
;;
;; The current main example for this is opening URLs that yield XML or JSON
;; responses, which are potentially even gzipped (think sitemaps for example).
;;
;; This package allows one to hook opener into evil.
;; It defines an :opener ex-state command as well as a remapping of gf (normal
;; state) to opener.

;; Full documentation is available as an Info manual.

(evil-define-command opener-evil-open (url-or-file &optional bang)
  "Open URL-OR-FILE. If the url doesn't have the scheme http:// or https:// it
  falls back to be equivalent to :edit"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "<a><!>")
