;;; Commentary:

;; opener.el is a small package that provides the user with the ability to open
;; files from http-like sources directly inside an Emacs buffer.  This means that
;; if the URL in question gives string hints to be a plaintext file, that isn't
;; automatically being rendered into a pleasant representation, like for example
;; html files are, it will be opened inside an Emacs buffer.
;;
;; The current main example for this is opening URLs that yield XML or JSON
;; responses, which are potentially even gzipped (think sitemaps for example).

;; Full documentation is available as an Info manual.
